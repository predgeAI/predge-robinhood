/// @title  PredgeValidatorBond
/// @notice Capital behind a verdict. The validation agent's blunt conclusion was that a
///         signed attestation is commodity — every competitor emits the same ed25519 + JCS
///         receipt, so matching the format is worth nothing. The one axis they cannot copy
///         is **skin in the game**: a validator that stakes money it loses if it is caught
///         lying. This contract is that stake, and — because Predge's acceptance test is
///         DETERMINISTIC (`sha256(deliverable) == expected`) — the slash is **trustless**:
///         anyone can prove a dishonest verdict on-chain with the `sha256` precompile. No
///         DAO vote, no optimistic dispute, no trusted adjudicator.
///
///         The deliverable is NEVER supplied by the challenger. It is read from the job
///         contract, where the PROVIDER — a different party, a different key — committed it
///         in its own transaction. The slash is therefore a comparison of two independent
///         on-chain commitments, and there is nothing for a challenger to forge.
///
///         Flow, per validation:
///           1. `stakeAndCommit(requestHash, expected, jobId)` — the validator posts a bond
///              and commits the acceptance test (the hash the provider's deliverable must
///              equal) BEFORE the work exists. The job is bound here: its `specHash` must be
///              this `requestHash` and its evaluator must be this validator, so the bond can
///              only ever be attached to a job this validator actually judges.
///           2. `recordScore(requestHash, score)` — the validator records its verdict
///              (100 = delivered / 0 = failed). This is the claim its bond backs.
///           3. `challenge(requestHash)` — ANYONE can call, with no arguments to forge. The
///              contract reads the deliverable the provider submitted to the job and slashes
///              the bond to the challenger iff the recorded verdict contradicts it:
///                 score 100 but deliverable != expected → falsely passed → SLASH
///                 score 0   but deliverable == expected → falsely failed → SLASH
///              An honest verdict is unslashable: with both sides of the comparison fixed
///              on-chain by two different parties, a challenge against it always reverts.
///           4. `reclaim(requestHash)` — after the dispute window with no successful
///              challenge, the validator withdraws its own bond.
///
///         The stake size is the validator's choice per request, and it is an economic floor as
///         much as a moral one: below the gas a challenge costs on that chain, nobody sends one
///         and the bond secures nothing. Demo loops here stake dust deliberately; a production
///         validator sizes the stake far above challenge gas.
///
///         So the validator's attestation is not "trust our signature" — it is "we have
///         staked USDC that anyone can take if we are wrong, and the test is public and
///         deterministic." That is the credible-commitment the receipt crowd lacks.
///
/// @dev    Bond is native value (on Arc, gas — and value — is USDC-denominated). Deterministic
///         acceptance tests only: `void`/subjective scores are recorded in the ERC-8004
///         registry but are out of scope here, because only a deterministic test can be
///         re-run trustlessly on-chain. Tiny, non-upgradeable, checks-effects-interactions.
/// @notice The slice of the ERC-8183 job contract this bond reads: what the provider
///         actually submitted, and who the job belongs to.
